Which would be better: a deck with 36 actions, or a deck with 36 creatures?

Obviously it would depend a lot on the quality of actions and creatures, but let’s assume the quality of the cards in each deck is equal.  Which would you prefer?

What if I told you I’d prefer neither. I want a deck with a balanced number of creatures AND actions! Okay, that’s a bit vague... Let’s talk about what the correct “balance” is (if there is one) of creatures vs actions in a deck (sorry, artifacts, you’ll have to wait for your own article).

Even if we could find a deck with 36 actions or 36 creatures, it probably wouldn’t be very good. Here’s why:  Actions and Creatures serve two distinct purposes: Creatures give you a benefit in the future; Actions give you a benefit immediately.

What does this mean? When you play a creature (unless it has a “Play” ability *1), it does not do anything on the turn you play it. You are expecting to use that creature on future turns. In this way, we can consider Creatures to be “slow” cards. When you play an Action, you want something to happen NOW. Unless you somehow retrieve that card from the discard pile, you will not be able to use it on future turns. In this way, we can consider Actions to be “fast” cards.

Since Keyforge is basically a race, why would we ever want “slow” cards? Wouldn’t 36 actions be better? No. Although it takes time to benefit from slow cards, they offer something that fast cards cannot: Options. More options means more powerful turns. This is why chains reduce the number of cards in your hand. They are a form of balancing the game because they limit one player’s options.

Here’s a simple example. You start the game with 6 cards (if you’re going second). On you first turn, you play 2 Brobnar creatures. You draw back up to 6 cards. Now you have the 6 cards in your hand as well as the 2 creatures on the field (assuming your opponent didn’t kill them). You now have 8 cards at your disposal. Imagine being able to draw back up to 8 cards every turn. That would put you at a huge advantage. Keeping creatures on the board gives you a similar advantage over the course of the game. This is the essential difference between Creatures and Actions. Creatures give you more options on future turns. 

Alright, so we want Actions for NOW, and we want Creatures for LATER. How can we use them together?

Let’s look at a practical example. Let’s say I’m going first. I can only play one card on my first turn. Should I play a creature or an action? More often than not, I will play a Creature over an Action on my first turn. That way, on my next turn, I will most likely have that creature available as another option. Playing an action first leaves me with fewer options on my second turn.

I hope I’ve helped you think about how to best use your Creatures and Actions. Let me know in the comments what you think the benefits of Creatures and Actions are.

footnotes:
*1 Creatures with “Play” abilities fit into a category of their own, since they give both “immediate” and “future” benefits.
