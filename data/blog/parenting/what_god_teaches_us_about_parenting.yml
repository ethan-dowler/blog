title: What God Teaches Us About Parenting

    - God calls Christ-followers his "children", so If we understand God's relationship with us, we will better understand God's purpose for our relationship with our children. Although we should provide structure and boundaries for our kids, rules and routines are not the most important things we can teach our kids. God provides for our physical needs, but every Christian would agree that his greatest gift to us was Jesus, his son, and the sacrifice Jesus made for us by dying for our sins, thus leading and reconciling us to God. Likewise, our greatest gift to our children is not meeting their physical needs. It's how well we lead them to Jesus.
    - title: The Grace of God
    - Marriam Webster defines "grace" as "unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification". We all know about God's grace to us, but what impact should that have on our relationship with our kids? How can we imitate God's example of grace?

      God gives us grace even when we don't ask for it. "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8. We can learn from Christ's example. We must show our children grace even when they push our buttons. Especially when they push our buttons. If God had waited for us to "behave" before sending Jesus, it never would have happened. We, too, should extend grace to our children while they are "still sinners".
    - That is not to say that there is no time for punishment. God disciplines us out of love. He knows what's best for us, so he steers us away from the things that will ultimately harm us, even though they seem pleasant at the time. Every kid loves sugar, but do we let our children eat sugar all day long? Of course not. That would lead to an upset stomach and much pain for the child, so we put loving boundaries around that, and if our child oversteps those boundaries, we employ a short-term punishment in order to teach them a long-term lesson. God does this numerous times throughout the Bible, so we know that we should too.
    - However, we should never let our kids' mistakes keep us from expressing our full and unwavering love for them. In the parable of the Lost Sheep (Luke 15), the shepherd pursues the lost sheep. Once he finds it, he carries it back to the flock and celebrates. We, too, must pursue our kids even when they don't want us to. God is our shepherd, and he has charged us to shephard our children. We cannot wait for our children to "earn" our favor because we cannot earn God's favor.
    - title: The Proactive Nature of God
    - >
      We should look for ways to help our children grow. We cannot wait around for them to ask us all the right questions because they may ask someone else instead - someone we can't trust (e.g. the internet). God showed his proactive nature in at least two ways. He sent Jesus, and he gave us the Bible. Again we can use Romans 5:8 as evidence of this. Let's read it again: "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
    - God always makes the first move. Every major character in the Bible was called on by God. Abraham, Moses, King David, Paul. All of these people had an encounter with God where God reached out to them and called them into his plan. Very rarely do we as humans seek him out, so why should we expect our kids to seek us first? This is why it's so important to be involved in your child's life. Spend time reading scripture with them, praying with them, and talking about God with them. We should be discipling our children because God disciples us.
    - title: The Providence of God
    - Have you ever considered that maybe God tasked us with providing our kids' physical needs because he provides our physical needs? I don't have a whole more to say about this point, but I just thought it would be good to mention that if you feed, clothe, and shelter your child, you're already reflecting God to your child. God provides our every need, so we provide our child's every need.
    - title: The Personal Nature of God
    - God has gifted each of us with specific passions and interests. God, who holds the universe together, who created everything, cares about your passions and interests. Likewise, we should learn to care about and appreciate our children's God-given passions and interests. You do not want to squander the passion that God has instilled in your child simply because you failed to look closely enough to see it. In fact, we should be the biggest proponents for helping our kids find their God-given talents and spiritual gifts. If you don't know your child's greatest fear and grandest dream, take some time soon to talk with them about it.
    - God cares about our little problems. He listens to us when we pray about things that are really small in the grand scheme of things. When your child comes up to you with a silly or stupid problem, how do you respond? If we ignore the "little" things our children come to us for help with, then we are unwittingly telling them that God doesn't care about their little problems. God meets us where we are, so we should meet our kids where they are, even if it seems silly or stupid to us.
    - title: The Security of God
    - One of my favorite characteristics of God is that he's unchanging. Unlike humans, God does not change his opinion or nature based on the time, culture, or environment. He is the same God, yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Because of this, we know that God's love for us will never change. We cannot lose God's love. We should seek to imitate his unchanging love in how we treat our children.
    - As parents, we are one of the few constants in our children's lives. Their world is full of uncertainty, but we can be a strong foundation for them the same way that God is a strong foundation for us. When the world hurts them, we will comfort them. When their abilities fail them, we will support them. When their world is flipped upside down, we will stand constantly beside them, loving them through it all. In this, we are showing God's love to our children.
