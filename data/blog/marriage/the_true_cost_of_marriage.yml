title: The True Cost of Marriage

    - Going into marriage, most people have the benefits of marriage in mind. It’s not hard to see the appeal. In fact, there are many benefits to marriage. Among them are companionship, partnership, friendship, romance, affection, encouragement, and support. It’s not hard to imagine these things because they are the most common things we see from the outside looking in. We know it will be hard work. We know there will be sacrifices. We know it’s a life-long promise. But how many of us know what it will take to create a strong, thriving marriage? I certainly don’t know everything that it will take, but here are a few things I’ve discovered.
    - title: Time & Calendar
    - You must check with your spouse before committing to doing anything that might conflict with your time together. I’m not saying that you need to spend 100% of your free time together. In fact, that would have its own negative consequences. However, you should not make plans with other people unless you have discussed it with your spouse before hand. 
    - This restriction on your time and calendar is something you don’t live with as a single person. You can go wherever you want whenever you want. You have no obligation to anybody, and giving that up can be difficult if you are used to catching dinner with friends after work or going to events that you are invited to last-minute.
    - I cannot stress enough how important it is to be clear with your spouse about what your plans are. They are your other half. You are one flesh. That means wherever you go, they go. Wherever they go, you go. Half of your body cannot be where the other half is not. It can be so easy to get caught up with ourselves that we forget how our presence (or absence) can impact our spouse.
    - title: Priorities & Dreams
    - You must consider your spouse’s hopes and dreams with the same passion that you have for your hopes and dreams. I know many stay-at-home mothers that left their career to stay home with their children. I know many fathers who work overtime shifts week after week in order to provide for their family. When you have a spouse, your priorities are no longer about what you want.
    - This is not to say that you must abandon all hope of achieving your dreams. You may be able to help each other pursue your respective dreams. Or better yet, you may both have the same dream. However, my key point here is that your dreams are secondary to your spouse’s dreams. You should not expect them to give up their dreams so that you can pursue yours. If you go into marriage assuming that, then you will both be heading in opposite directions. Make sure you regularly talk together about what your goals are for the short and long term. The best goals are ones that you decide on together.
    - As husband and wife, you should be each others’ greatest cheerleaders, but sometimes that means sacrificing what you want for the greater good of your family. If you haven’t had to sacrifice anything recently, then your spouse may be the one who’s doing all the sacrificing. You should be actively looking for ways to make your spouse’s dreams come true.
    - title: Habits & Preferences
    - This one seems rather obvious. You must learn to compromise. We learn that in grade school. Not everyone can have their way. Simple, right? Well, it’s simple on paper, but how well do you really know yourself? What things have you grown so accustomed to that you don’t even realize that they're habits. "Surely everyone does it this way." "There’s no way anyone would do it that way." Ha. I would make some joke about how it’s funny how God puts you with someone so different from you, but I don’t think he has to try very hard to do that. We are all unique, and that includes our habits and preferences.
    - I can’t tell you the number of small, seemingly stupid things that I’ve changed over the years to accomodate my wife. And she probably can’t tell you the number of small, seemingly stupid things that she puts up with to accommodate me. During the dating phase, these things seem amusing, almost cute. But when you live with them 24/7, and they’re grating you with these little things, almost as if their taunting you, how will you respond? Will you lay down your own preferences in support of your spouse? Will you go through the painstaking process of talking through the boring, mundane processes and habits that irk you so much?
    - It takes emotional courage to bring up the little annoyances, but addressing them early and often (i.e. before you really get mad about them) will prevent major explosions later on. A car engine requires many, small explosions to run correctly, but one big explosion can damage the engine permanently. You have to decide to love your spouse more than you love your routines.
    - title: Hobbies
    - Do you like spending time with your spouse? Do you like spending time with your hobbies? For me, that’s a "yes" and "yes". Unfortunately, there is seldom enough time in a day to spend as much time as I would like on both. Every evening, you have a choice. Do you pursue your hobby? Or do you pursue your spouse? In my experience, it is best to have a healthy balance between the two. If you try too hard to force time with your spouse, it will feel suffocating. If you always choose your hobby over your spouse, it will feel lonely. In an ideal world, you can have both, but over the course of a lifetime, they are unlikely to align 100% of the time, so learning to balance your time is important.
    - The great thing about hobbies, though, is that they make it very easy for you to show your spouse how much you love them. One way to love your spouse well is to ask them about their favorite hobby. Get emotionally invested in the things they care about. Does your spouse love gardening? Do some research, and buy a plant that you help them raise. You don’t have to plant an entire flower bed with them, but researching and planting a single plant that you work on together will show your spouse that you love them enough to come into their world. You may feel out of your element, but your spouse will feel loved, and it will energize them to come into your world.
    - title: Family
    - Wait, what? By getting married, aren’t you gaining a family? Yes, yes you are. However, this also means you are leaving a family. When speaking about marriage, the Bible says, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24 ESV). This does not mean you do not value your parents. It does not mean you ignore them. What it means is that you need to rearrange your priorities. The opinions of your father, mother, sister, and brother are secondary to the opinions of your spouse.
